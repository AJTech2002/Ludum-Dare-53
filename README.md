# Ludum-Dare-53

A small game made for Ludum Dare 53 for the theme of Delivery, objective of the game is to move the trucks around to deliver to each of the houses without crashing into eachother & to beat your personal record time. Game can be extended to add pedestrians, traffic lights and more control on the truck's movement, however due to the lack of time this was not possible.
